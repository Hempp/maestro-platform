The difference between 'help me with emails' and a well-structured prompt is the difference between a confused intern and a senior assistant who knows exactly what you need.\n\nThink of it like giving directions. 'Go somewhere nice' vs 'Take Highway 101 North for 2 miles, exit at Oak Street, the restaurant is on the left with a blue awning.' Which one gets you there?\n\nEvery effective prompt has four key components: Context, Task, Format, and Constraints (CTFC). Master these, and your AI outputs become predictable and high-quality.",
