## Email Templates

### Segment: Students

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- "Stop listing 'ChatGPT' as a skill"
- "The portfolio project that actually gets interviews"
- "AI skills employers can verify (not just trust)"

**Short Email (Cold):**
```
Subject: Stop listing "ChatGPT" as a skill

Hey {first_name},

Every junior dev lists "AI/ML" on their resume now. Nobody believes it.

What if you could prove it with a deployed project AND a blockchain-verified credential?

Phazur teaches you to build real AI workflows (not just prompt), and when you ship something real, you get an on-chain SBT that employers can actually verify.

Free to learn. Pay $49 only after you're certified.

Want early access?

**Follow-up (Day 3):**
```
Subject: Re: Stop listing "ChatGPT" as a skill

Quick follow-up—

Saw you opened my last email. Here's what one student built in week 2:

→ AI-powered portfolio site that updates itself
→ Deployed live, not localhost
→ Took 6 hours total

The credential? Permanently on Polygon. No PDF that anyone can fake.

Still interested?

### Segment: Employees

**Subject Lines:**
- "Delete 10 hours of busywork this week"
- "Your coworkers will think you cloned yourself"
- "The automation your IT team won't build for you"

**Short Email (Cold):**
```
Subject: Delete 10 hours of busywork this week

Hey {first_name},

You probably spend 10+ hours/week on tasks that should be automated:
- Summarizing meeting notes
- Formatting reports
- Answering the same Slack questions

What if you built a "digital clone" that handles all of it?

Phazur teaches you to build real AI automations—not toy demos. By week 3, you'll have a custom GPT trained on YOUR workflows.

Free to learn. $199 only after you deploy something real.

Worth a look?

**Follow-up (Day 3):**
```
Subject: Re: Delete 10 hours of busywork this week

{first_name}—

One more thing:

A product manager in our beta cut her weekly reporting time from 6 hours to 45 minutes.

She built an AI that:
1. Pulls data from 3 tools
2. Writes the summary
3. Formats it for leadership

Took her 2 weeks to build. Now runs automatically every Friday.

That's the Employee path. Interested?

### Segment: Owners

**Subject Lines:**
- "Fire your next hire before you make it"
- "The AI system that replaced my research team"
- "Scale to 10x without 10x headcount"

**Short Email (Cold):**
```
Subject: Fire your next hire before you make it

Hey {first_name},

Before you post that job listing, consider this:

One founder in our program built an AI sales research system in 3 weeks. It now:
- Finds leads matching his ICP
- Researches their company + pain points
- Drafts personalized outreach

Runs 24/7. Cost: $50/month in API calls.

That's what the Owner path teaches—multi-agent systems that replace entire functions.

Free to learn. $499 after you deploy.

Worth exploring?

Hey {first_name}—saw you're breaking into tech. Quick q: are you building AI projects yet or just learning about them? Working on something that might help.
```

**Employee (Connection Request Note):**
```
{first_name}—noticed you're in {role}. Curious: how much time do you spend on repetitive tasks that AI could handle? Building something for knowledge workers.
```

**Owner (Connection Request Note):**
```
{first_name}—saw you're scaling {company}. Quick question: have you automated any ops with AI yet, or still mostly manual? Working on something relevant.
```

```

**Employee:**
```

- **Free to learn, pay after you ship** — removes risk objection

## Response Handling

**"What's the catch?"**
> No catch—we only make money when you succeed. You learn free, build something real, and only pay ($49-499 depending on path) when you're certified. If you don't finish, we don't get paid.

**"I don't have time"**
> Totally get it. Most people do 30-60 min/day. The Student path takes 2-4 weeks at that pace. And the time you invest now saves 10x later when AI handles your busywork.

**"How is this different from ChatGPT?"**
> ChatGPT is a tool. We teach you to build systems WITH AI—automated workflows, custom GPTs, multi-agent chains. You don't just use AI, you command it.
